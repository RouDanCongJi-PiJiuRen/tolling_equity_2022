- Description: WSDOT said: "Enclosed is the SED data set (2015, 2025 and 2045) provided to us by BERK for our I-405 Level II T&R Study. The households within each TAZ are stratified into 4 income levels: Low (<$30k), Mid-Low ($30-60k), Mid-High ($60-90k) and High (>$90k)." Mark said: "I also uploaded (in the folder "Income Distribution for Tolling) an Excel file passed along by Eric of the household income values used by WSDOT when they were performing their last toll and revenue study. (The estimate of how much money they will make.)"
