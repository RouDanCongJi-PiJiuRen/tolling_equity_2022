toll_pts_405
- Date: mid July 2019 
- Source: Saved out Google Maps map, which can be accessed/edited at the following link: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?hl=en&mid=11ubgIDrkdHDrKBycIS_R4qSpjmX2IHHb&ll=47.71752294582027%2C-122.2125484&z=11 
- Point person: Shirley 
- Description: Generated with very meticulous looking at satellite view + streetview on Google Maps to map all the entry/exit points (beg and end), their associated toll plazas, and toll price signs (only northbound for toll price signs though because Shirley got lazy). Saved as a map in Google Maps. Then exported as kml file. Then ran the command line command: "ogr2ogr -f 'ESRI Shapefile' output.shp input.kml" to convert from kml to shapefile. Could probably also use https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/kml-to-shp if you don't have GDAL installed.
