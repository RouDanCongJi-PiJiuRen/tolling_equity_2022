<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

State Routes are depicted as lines with State Route identifiers. Each SR is symbolized with a single line whether or not the highway is divided. Entrance, exit and collector/distributor ramps are not included, but spurs, couplets and reversible lanes are.

</dd>
<dt><em>Purpose:</em>  
<dd>

The data provide a small-scale cartographic rendition of Washington State highways. They also represent the linear reference system (LRS) used by Washington State Department of Transportation. This data set is used: 1) for general-purpose base mapping; 2) as a Linear Referencing System (LRS); 3) for locating features on the State Route network by State Route Accumulated Route Mileage (dynamic segmentation). This dataset is a snapshot of the roadway system, effective 12/31/2018.

These data form a network representing the connectivity of State Routes (SR's) for Washington state. Nodes occur at SR endpoints and at points of intersection with other SR's, ramps, bridges, and county boundaries. This includes all State Routes, US Routes, Interstates, Frontage Roads, Local Access ramps, Ferry Terminals and some Proposed routes located within the TRIPS database.

</dd>
<dt><em>Completeness_Report:</em>

The data set contains all of the state routes in the State of Washington. San Juan County contains no State Routes.

3/14/1997 - Michelle Blake The source file state.dgn was digitized from various printed maps--principally the USGS Washington State wall map--using Intergraph Microstation software. Srclean.dgn contains state.dgn state routes depicted as single lines. In cases where highways are divided and intersect with other SR's, the intersection of the increasing sides were chosen for depiction. The srclean.dgn file was converted into an Arc/Info coverage with the Arc &quot;IGDSARC&quot; command. Attributes storing the beginning and ending route measures for each line were added using custom menus in &quot;ARCEDIT,&quot; and routes were created with the &quot;ARCSECTION&quot; command. The coverage was transformed to geographic coordinates using Arc commands &quot;PROJECTDEFINE&quot; and &quot;PROJECT.&quot; This produced the 1996 LRS. 01/15/1999 - Thomas A. Blake The 1998 version of this data set was updated with the changes that had occurred to the State Highway System. This update was reflected in the 1998 LRS. 10/23/2001 - Thomas A. Blake The 2000 version of this data set was updated with the changes that had occurred to the State Highway System. This update was reflected in the 2000 LRS. 12/01/2004 - Heather Spates The 2001 version of this data set was updated with the changes that had occurred to the State Highway System. The data was projected from geographic coordinates to Washington State Plane South NAD 83. This update was reflected in the 2003 LRS. 01/16/2006 - Heather Spates Ferry Terminals located in the TRIPS systems and selected Proposed routes (found in both TRIPS and other records) are included in this edition. Ferry Terminals were located via orthophotos on the end of cartographically drawn ferry routes. Proposed route linework are compiled from paper contract sheets. This update was reflected in the 2004 LRS 2/6/2006 - Heather Spates The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2005 Washington State Road Log. This update was reflected in the 2005 LRS. 07/24/2006 - Jordyn Mitchell 4 new attributes were added with the 2006 update. SRID, RID, RRT, RRQ. These were added to enable easier sorting and selecting of records. These were derived from the SR field. This update was reflected in the 2006 LRS. 05/21/2008 - Julie Fogde The 2007 LRS is an update of the 2006 LRS. A copy of the Lines file of the 2006 LRS was updated using the 2007 Highway Log, GPS LRS, orthophotos, highway contract plans, and WSDOT project websites. Polylines were then broken out by direction and built into routes. This update was reflected in the 2007 LRS. 06/03/2009 - Derek Drake The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2008 Washington State Road Log. This update was reflected in the 2008 LRS. 05/25/2010 - Thomas A. Blake The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2009 Washington State Road Log. A new attribute LRS Date was added to indicate the valid date of the measures (ARMs) used to update the data set. This update was reflected in the 2009 LRS. 03/31/2011 - Thomas A. Blake The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2010 Washington State Road Log. This update was reflected in the 2010 LRS. 11/15/2011 - Thomas A. Blake The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the Washington State Highway Log as of 9/30/2010. 04/15/2012 - Thomas A. Blake The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2011 Washington State Road Log. This update was reflected in the 2011 LRS. 06/15/2012 - Thomas A. Blake The Region attribute along US 12 was updated to reflect a WSDOT Region Boundary change between the Southwest and South Central regions. No other changes were made. 03/15/2013 - Thomas A. Blake The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2012 Washington State Road Log. This update was reflected in the 2012 LRS. 04/05/2014 - Thomas A. Blake The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2013 Washington State Road Log. This update was reflected in the 2013 LRS. 3/15/2015 - Jordyn Mitchell All LRS data stored in SDE was migrated to a new server. Several attributes (SR, SRID, RRT, RRQ) were dropped, replaced, or recalculated to conform to a consistent schema. 04/01/2015 - Thomas A. Blake The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2014 Washington State Road Log. This update was reflected in the 2014 LRS. 04/01/2016 - Thomas A. Blake The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2015 Washington State Road Log. This update was reflected in the 2015 LRS. 03/01/2017 - Thomas A. Blake The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2016 Washington State Road Log. This update was reflected in the 2016 LRS. 02/01/2018 - Thomas A. Blake The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2017 Washington State Road Log. This update was reflected in the 2017 LRS. 04/15/2019 - Thomas A. Blake The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2018 Washington State Road Log. This update was reflected in the 2018 LRS
