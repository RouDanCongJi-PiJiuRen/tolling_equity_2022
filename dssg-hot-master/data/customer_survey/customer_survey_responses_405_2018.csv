I believe that there is actually MORE congestion since the lanes have been installed, from what I have observed during my time using 405 and how it looked before and after the toll lanes were installed. I believe there is more congestion because people are using the same amount of lanes, but now there are TWO unfavorable lanes for the toll lanes, because people do not want to pay the money for them whether by getting a pass or by paying fees on a case-by-case basis, causing a majority of the regular lanes to become congested.","They have been helpful SOMETIMES to improve the speed at which I am traveling, most of the time I use them only if they are free.

King County refuses to widen roads, and instead takes away lanes ... frustrating, to say the least. I have lived here for 13 years, and traffic has gotten worse and worse. The toll roads do not ease congestion; in fact they make congestion worse for those not in the toll lane and on arterial roads. Paying $10 tolls is, quite frankly, out of my price range. I am single, and I work for a non-profit. Property taxes are skyrocketing, and I cannot afford paying up to $10 to drive on a road that I am already paying taxes on. It used to take me 20 to 30 minutes to get to my parents' house (Kingsgate to Lynnwood), even with traffic. It now takes 35 or more minutes to do the same journey. This is ancedotal, but a coworker, who drives from Lynnwood to Redmond every day, confirmed that her commute is much worse since the toll lanes were installed. For those who are wealthy, it is not a hardship to pay up to $10 per trip; but I should not have to pay that cost to see my parents or to go to the doctor, especially since my taxes already pay for this road.","Not much.  Seriously. People illegally cut in and out of them, making them an added danger to motorists.  They are ridiculously expensive, at times; they cater to the elite of society - people who can afford to pay will while those who cannot sit in the traffic. Granted, you have pulled in a boatload of money from the tolls (isn't that always the reason behind such ""time saving"" systems), but where is that money going? The roads aren't being improved. And, ""best"" of all, people, who pay to drive in them for a faster way to get where they need to go, still sit in traffic (Kingsgate to Lynnwood). "

I was commuting, working, shopping in Bellevue frequently, but now can almost never go there because traffic is so bad and we cannot enter the carpool lanes.  It is a serious inconvenience and every trip has to now be planned since it takes so long to get into an Express Lane from Exit 18 (downtown Kirkland).  It easily added 10 minutes to our commute to Bellevue from Kirkland every day!!!  This is crazy.","The express toll lanes make total sense BUT the execution of them for I405 is extremely poor.  I'm happy to pay tolls, as well as carpool, but there MUST be many more entrance points (the location and number of exit points is fine).  There seems to be no reason not to add more entrance points, since the scanner doesn't need to scan until the car LEAVES the carpool (it can determine at what point the car ENTERED based on previous scanner locations not having picked them up).  PLEASE FIX THIS, the current design has created a nightmare for local traffic around Kirkland and Bellevue areas.  Longer distance trips are shorter or same amount of time (e.g. my trips from/to Lynnwood), but more local trips have gone WAY up, negating all value to the Express Toll Lanes for those who use it the most (multiple times daily)."

Yes - if they were truly faster trips. Many a times even after paying the toll, we don't get the promised minimum speed of 40 miles per hour. Tolls are per slots/lengths of the road. So, customers are paying multiple tolls per single work trip. If you look at any other states, these toll rates are comparatively quite expensive and insane while promised value (speed) is almost impossible to deliver. Specially, we have some safety issues because people do cross lanes even though it's a hard line. One option may be to provide cheaper single toll lane and only for longer length trips. Shorter length toll lane use  should be discouraged by how they get charged. ","If we get to see some of the above suggestions, there may be something to like to regular basis. Otherwise as it stands today, it's just more unsafe travel and one has to get lucky to get promised speed."

This would reduce the number of people that have to exit the express lanes and merge across traffic to get to the regular exits. Also it really irritates me that when I drive my cat to the vet I can't use the express lane for free but someone driving their baby can use the express lanes.  Having an infant in the car does not make it a carpool. Unless you want to allow pets to count, then I'm OK with babies.",I like that there  are limited areas for entering and exiting. This means I don't have to worry about crazy lane shifters as much.  Need to do a better job educating the public about not crossing the double lines though.

There seems so be a big disconnect for the people starting up north and the traffic is terrible. I think if it was more accessible for people to travel a few miles for less that might help decongest the area a little. I also think that taking away the access point around 522 has caused so much congestion and people cut across the lines line crazy because the traffic there is so bad and the access point is so far away they just cut the lines and aren't following the rules. ,That I can drive in them as a single person and not break the law. Carpool lanes never allowed me to have a faster option when driveing alone. But my commute was 15 minutes on 405 when carpooling because I could get all the way to my exit driving all the way in the carpool lanes and now I can only drive in the express lanes for a mile or two and then I have to sit in traffic anyway and pay 10.00 and now it takes 30+ minutes no matter what. I think it's a great option for people traveling a farther distance but really messed it up for people like me when I only have to go 3.5 miles on 405 and no matter what my commute will cost the same as someone driving into Bellevue.

However, what happens when the traffic piles up in the toll lane and the traffic is now moving the same speed in all lanes (toll and non toll lanes)?  You get a ton of unhappy toll paying people.  This is the one negative thing about the toll lane.  I've paid over 10$ at times to sit in traffic that is slower then the non-toll lanes.  This makes absolutely no sense and since you can't leave the toll lanes at anytime you get stuck and you paying to be stuck... You need to fix this somehow.  I don't care what the solution is, just make it so I'm not paying to sit in traffic.  The way it is now doesn't work at all when traffic builds up in the toll lane. Maybe make the toll lane free when the traffic is the same speed in all lanes.  Basically only charge when the lane is actually faster (proven somehow, by analytic live data).  I think it would also help if the toll lane was two lanes all the way north to I5 connection.  However you can't take away a lane from non-toll lanes as that would just make traffic worse all around.  I want a newly built lane, or widen the freeway overall and add more lanes that way.","It works sometimes, and I like using it on the weekends and when free.  A lot of people avoid it even when free so it's nice to have a lane to myself when this happens (which isn't that often)."

Except there's no way I'm paying $6 to get there faster!"

I used to carpool with my husband and now there's no point because we still pay so it isn't worth coordinating our schedules. Also, they are by far the highest tolls I have seen in any state or country for that matter I have driven in and it doesn't seem like any of the money is going anywhere to properly fund road improvement nor does the price you pay significantly make the trip faster because often times it's still stop and go. Washington already pays significantly higher taxes where is that money going toward road improvement - people can't afford a $20 a day toll and people are being forced to pay that because they are having to move farther outside city limits.  If you're going to take away one lane for tolling and away from two person carpools because honestly who really has three people they can carpool with, there should be an additional lane to ease the remaining traffic because it's only seemed to make problems worse.

Possibly installingTarget cameras in between toll cameras to catch people who jump on or off in non designated areas. Serious safety Hazard.  It's a good start.  Maybe better way to keep people from accessing the Hot Lanes in non designated areas other than just lines painted.  ,It gives commuters options for the ability to travel quickly to destinations or not. It also allows revenue needed for paying for other DOT projects. Unlike Sound Transit which jerks money at incredible overpaying rates. The State DOT and city's should share some of the revenue from these hot lanes and get rid of tolling the 520 after a few years and just does Exoress Toll lanes (hot lanes)

How much of my $20 daily toll actually goes to improving the highway or is even funneled back into local communities and government? My understanding is that some ~70% of my toll goes to the company who installed and operates the equipment, and they're located in Texas and have no concerns with traffic in the greater Seattle area. It's a luxury for the middle to high end households that further opresses the poor. Not to mention, the areas where drivers are allowed to enter/exit toll lanes are CONSTANTLY congested because of drivers quickly merging to and from toll lanes to their exits, i.e. they further congest the regular lanes. In one example, in the 2 lanes through Bothell I saw a vehicle enter the freeway, get into the left regular lane, and then STOP in the left lane for ~10s until they found an opening to squeeze  into the toll lane -- how does that at all solve our traffic problem?! Not to mention, who thought it'd be a good idea to reduce the 405 in Bothell down to 2 regular lanes to install a toll lane?! How does that solve the traffic problem? I bought a motorcycle after spending $100 a week in tolls, and now I risk my life on the daily to get a free toll pass.

Not all of the on/off points are listed but people are expected to know they have to pay the cost to the next off point when common sense would tell you that you'd only pay that amount if you went as far as that destination.  IE: if you get off at Canyon Park you pay the much higher amount for going to the I-5 interchange rather than the lower amount of getting off at 195th.  Please fix this!
