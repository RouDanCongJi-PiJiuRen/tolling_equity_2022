# Notebook Overview

* geo_travel_behavior.ipynb - looks at common attributes of census block groups and travel behavior
* hov_with_tolls_exploration.ipynb - looks further into why some trips marked HOV have tolls
* initial_analysis.ipynb - initial analysis of non-trip level data
* joined_data_analysis.ipynb - analysis of trip data with initial census estimates; includes early maps
* mcib_replication.ipynb - replication of the means-constrained integration brackets method for estimating means of bins of census groups
* modal_vot.ipynb - analysis of HOV users
* presentation_viz.ipynb - creating analysis for presentation
* speed_vol_exploration.ipynb - exploration of relationships between speed, volume and travel time
* survey_analysis.ipynb - analysis of WSDOT survey from 2017
* travel_behavior.ipynb - looking into single users' predictibility and commuting patterns
   
   **-feel free to look more into this - this analysis mainly shows that most people traveling in the HOT lanes do not travel in regular patterns that are easy to identify. i think it'd be interesting to try and quantify how many of these users actually use the facility predictibly and are "regular commuters" (however you define that)**
   
* unusual_trips_and_fips.ipynb - exploring unusually high frequency trips and areas
* wsdot_initial_analysis.ipynb - initial analysis of non-matched trip-level data
